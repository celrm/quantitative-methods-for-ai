    "## Visualising arrays with 2 elements in x-y Euclidean space\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the mini-lectures it is often useful to think of vectors as arrows pointing into space (the 'physicists' view), which allows for various **geometric** interpretations. In the case of a 1-D array with two elements this would be in 2-D space (i.e. typically `x-y` Euclidean space). A 1-D array with three elements would represent points in 3-D space (typically visualised as `x-y-z` space). A 1-D array with four elements moves us into 4-D space, but for >3-D space we have some trouble coming up with simple visualisations!\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, sticking to the simple 2-D case - i.e. a 1-D array with two elements, such as the examples above - we can have a shot at visualising these.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike graphics such as scatterplots or histograms, visualising vectors is not that straighforward in Python. Some of you may disagree and/or prove me wrong but I have not found a simple approach. There is a **pyGame** library that may make things easier, but I have not had time to explore it properly. So the solution below feels a bit 'clunky' and seems like a lot of work just to show 3 lines, but using the `quiver` plot was the best option I could come up with (that did not involve explitly finding the end points of each line and specifying that).\n"
