    "We will be using 2-D arrays to represent matrices (as the NumPy developers have noted that the `matrix` data type is likely soon to be depricated), and as of Python version 3.5 there is a built-in operator (`@`) for matrix (as opposed to element-wise) multiplication...  (Previously the `*` operator was interpreted as 'matrix multiplication' when applied to `matrix` objects, but that was about the only reason that you would have used that specific data type prior to the `@` operator being available. However, you do need to remember that when applyng the `*` operator to arrays of any dimensions - including 2-D arrays to represent classic matrices - this will always be interpreted as a request to carry out element-wise multiplication.) \n",
