    "## Creating and working with *NumPy* arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being the way in which we work with vectors (and indeed matrices and tensors!) the NumPy `array` class is at the heart of almost **ALL** data manipulation in Python. For example, `Pandas` is built on top of the notion of NumPy arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first section we will (mostly) work with 1-dimensional arrays, representing vectors, but this class supports the general-purpose `n-dimensional` array which is used in many sorts of numerical computing - including many ML algorithms. The notion of a `matrix` is really only required in more classic computations specific to linear algebra, with matrix objects being limited to exactly **two** dimensions. While the concepts of matrix multiplication and other transformations from linear algebra are of course important, the mathematical objects of matrices can (and arguably, *should*) be thought of as simply 2-dimensional arrays - which will avoid the need to switch between the 'currencies' of `array` and `matrix`. Indeed it is proposed that the `matrix` object type may soon be depricated from the official Python language. If interested you read more in the NumPy developer's post on - [array or matrix - Which should I use?](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html#array-or-matrix-which-should-i-use)\n"
