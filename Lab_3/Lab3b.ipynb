Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game.

    "Sometimes it is inconvenient to explicitly define a sample space. Perhaps the sample space is infinite, or perhaps it is just very large and complicated, and we feel more confident in writing a program to *simulate* one pass through all the complications, rather than try to *enumerate* the complete sample space. *Random sampling* from the simulation\n",

    "Consider [problem 84](https://projecteuler.net/problem=84) from the excellent [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), which asks for the probability that a player in the game Monopoly ends a roll on each of the squares on the board.  To answer this we need to take into account die rolls, chance and community chest cards, and going to jail (from the \"go to jail\" space, from a card, or from rolling doubles three times in a row). We do not need to take into account anything about buying or selling properties or exchanging money or winning or losing the game, because these don't change a player's location. We will assume that a player in jail will always pay to get out of jail immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "A game of Monopoly can go on forever, so the sample space is infinite. But even if we limit the sample space to say, 1000 rolls, there are $21^{1000}$ such sequences of rolls (and even more possibilities when we consider drawing cards). So it is infeasible to explicitly represent the sample space.\n",
    "\n",

Though interestingly the `red` set {Strand, Fleet St, Trafalgar Sq} actually have better odds of being landed on...  but they are more expensive to develop - which is where the strategy and decision-making part of the game interacts with the absolute probabilities of landing on different sqaures.\n",
